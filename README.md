# Weather_Dashboard
A simple weather dashboard.

## Functionality
When deployed, the user is presented with a weather dashboard, showcasing the current weather and five day forecast (by default) for Detroit, MI. The user may use a search bar to view the weather for other cities. Each entry, up to five, is stored in localStorage and a set of buttons is generated below the search bar to allow the user to go back to previous searches.
